- Gnome: complete synth voice based on Fundamental modules

- Snake: multicore (experimental!) introduces a small delay!
  if in doubt check the difference signal of in and output.

  this signal is then available at all other instances (red light).

- Humo (standard Clouds): new skins for the alternate modes: Espectro, Ritardo, Camilla

- Sssh: 4 copies of the noise/S+H section from Kinks, normalized

- Fuse: fixes to gate/trigger behavior

- Blank panels: 1HP, 2HP, 4HP, 8HP, 16HP, 42HP - nothing special for now but watch this space
